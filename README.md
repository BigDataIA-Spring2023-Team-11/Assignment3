<h3> Description </h3>

In this repository, we are going to add functionality to the existing Goes-Nexrad Streamlit Application from Assignment 1.
The following changes have been incorporated to enhance the Application reusability.
* 1. Fast API : 

* 2. Docker:
  
* 3. Great Expectation:
     1. Great Expectation hosted on s3 bucket : http://data-great-expect.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com





<h3> Flow of Data</h3>

1. NOAA's website has raw GOES and NEXRAD satellite data.
2. This data is scraped in order to generate metadata, which is then stored in SQLite.
3. These values pertain to metadata directories.
4. There is an Authentication page that authenticates the user.
5. The user has access to our Exploration Web App, where he must specify the 'Year,' 'Day,' and 'Hour'.
6. Using these values, a unique file is fetched and a link to download the file displayed.
7. User can also use the filename to retrive and download the file.
8. Downloaded file is in .NC format, used to store multidimensional data.


1. Streamlit

* Implementation of login page and allowing authenticated users to interact with the dashboard.[1]
* Sending RestAPI calls to FastAPI endpoints and display the returned response.

2. FastAPI
* Endpoints as per the usecase.
* Process of file transfer within fastapi with status of the request returned appropriatly to streamlit. Example, if the user inputs are invalid, the response return code should be “400 - Bad Request”

3. Airflow
* Create DAG’s with task’s in order of their dependency.
